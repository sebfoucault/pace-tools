# Performance index and race time estimate


A theory defines a performance index PI as that:
- Can be calculated from the time spent to run a given distance
- Can be used to infer the time to run other distances

Let define:
- Velocity v = d / t in m/min

The performance index is defined as:
- pi = i / imax
where
- i = -4.60 + 0.182258 * v + 0.000104 * v^2
- imax = 0.8 + 0.1894393 * exp( -0.012778 * t ) + 0.2989558 * exp( -0.1932605 * t )
